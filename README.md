Fundamentals 5 - Calculator project

- CSS Grid
- Use of attributes to store data
- creation of classes

I still have my Texas Instruments calculator from the mid 80s so used this for the style.  I had to read a number of calculator tutorials to get going on the scripting.

Approach:
> Identify key pressed
> Keep first and subsequent numbers and display
> When operator pressed need to store and operator key type
> Return calculation
> Include decimal when pressed but not more than one
> DEL to remove last number
> Set display to 0 if ON/C key pressed and clear any attributes set
> OFF key removes display and any attributes set


Work in progress:
- ordering of calculation - requires code refactor
- % to be used in calculation
