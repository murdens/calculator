Fundamentals 5 - Calculator project

- CSS Grid
- Use of attributes to store data
- creation of classes

I still have my Texas Instruments calculator from the mid 80s so used this for the style.  I had to read a number of calculator tutorials to get going on the scripting.

Work in progress:
- delete button requires function
- order of calculation bugs
